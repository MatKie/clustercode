Example by: T Lindeboom
The example is of a similation of water and a monoglyceride (referred MGE C18) using a coarse grain model by T Lindeboom. The simulation is in a triclinic box and starts in a mixed state and equilibrates to an laminar phase. The simulation is for 500 ns at 423 K and water mass fraction of 0.25.
