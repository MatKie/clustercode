Example by: T Lindeboom
The example is of a similation of water and a monoglyceride (referred MGE C18) 
using a coarse grain model by T Lindeboom. The simulation is in a triclinic box 
and starts in a mixed state and equilibrates to an laminar phase.

Simulation details:
    - Time: 500 ns
    - Temperature: 423 K
    - Water mass fraction: 0.25
    - Pressure: 10 bar
    - Triclinic box
