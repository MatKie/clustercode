    "First we calculate the nematic order parameters of the initial configuration. The nematic order parameter gives information about how things are alligned in the system and is a measure of directional order, it ranges from -0.5 (antinematic) to 0 (isotropic) to 1 (nematic). The supplied trajectory file (files_orderparams/traj.xtc) has all the atoms in the box (gromacs flag -pbc atom), the molecules need to be made whole to do the nematic order parameter analysis thus we supply the parameter pbc_style='mol' to the nematic_op_analysis() method, which uses the gromacs command gmx trjconv to convert the file into the desired format (alternatively this could be done externally and a trajectory file with the gromacs flag -pbc mol could be supplied).\n",

This can be seen visually using VMD, in files_orderparams folder run the command: vmd init.gro traj.xtc -e vmdlog.
