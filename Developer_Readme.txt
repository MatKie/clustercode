Hey everyone, 

Just links to a few useful pages regarding git and code formatting:

Code formatting: 
It would be quite cool, if we could document everything well. The style
guidelines for this are included in PEP-8 and PEP-257(docstrings). I
also appended an article, which has all the information with examples.

Git:
Git is a bit complicated to get into and I'm just getting used to it.
However, I think if you make it a habit for coding there are great
advantages. There is a difference between git and github. Git can 
be used on your local machine and allows you to switch between 
different states of your code. Github does the same with a remote
repository, where different people can contribute.
I got you a link for a tutorial, which only should take you half an hour.
